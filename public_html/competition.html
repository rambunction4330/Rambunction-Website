                FIRST Stronghold & Toro
              </h3>
              <p>
                The objective of FIRST Stronghold is for an alliance to breach the opposing alliance’s defenses and capture their castle. There are nine possible defenses: the Portcullis, Cheval de Frise, Moat, Ramparts, Drawbridge, Sally Port, Rock Wall, Rough Terrain, and Low Bar; a combination of ten are put on the field including: the permanent low bars, two obstacles selected by the audience, and three on each side chosen by the alliances to defend their castle. Alliances can score points by crossing defenses and scoring foam balls, "boulders," in the castle goals. Robots can either shoot the boulders into low goals or high goals on top of the castle.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our robot for FIRST Stronghold, named Toro, is a low-goal defense clearer. It can cross every defense consistently except the moat and score boulders into either side of the castle. It uses its Trex 				Arms, a horizontal rod that moves up and down, to lower the panels on the Cheval de Frise, as well as to raise the Portcullis. An intake system with horizontal rollers above a polycarbonate plate allows boulders to be stored and shot out of the robot.

                        Recycle Rush & Scorpion
                    </h3>
          
                    <p>
                        The objective of Recycle Rush is to stack totes and recycling containers on the scoring platforms. Opposing alliances can also choose to help one another during some rounds by stacking four "coopertition" totes on a step in the middle of the field. During play, totes can be stacked on top of steps in the field. For every level (measured in height) that the stack clears, more points are awarded for the stack. Recycling bins are also avaiable and can be stacked on top of these totes for extra points! "Litter" is given to teams as pool noodles. Human players on either alliance can throw trash to the other side; litter not in the Landfill Zone before the end of the match will score points for the opposing alliance. Litter can also be put into a recycling bin for extra points.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our robot from this year is named Scorpion for its "fanged" plates that scope up and stack bins without fail and for the long "tail" that can lift and stack a recycling bin on the stack of totes it has just picked up. Flexible and fast, Scorpion utilizes mechinam drive so that it can go in any direction on the field, allowing for more time collecting and stacking bins. It can hold up to a grand total of six totes and a recycling bin all at once.

                Aerial Assist & Caribou
              </h3>
              <p>
                Aerial Assist is played by two teams, each team trying to score as many points as possible by throwing and catching foam balls. Teams score points by going through differently colored sections of the field and by passing the ball to alliance members. Throwing the ball over the Truss and having another member catch it scores extra points. Once at the end section, a team may launch the ball into the goal to earn points as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our robot, Caribou, was made to retrieve balls from the floor or the human player and shoot them over the Truss or into the goals. It utilized tank drive to make it sturdy so that it could play defense and block over robots or keep other robots from throwing it off as it shot. Wings on the top kept the ball from falling, and the arm mechanism could be folded in for the starting position (pictured) before locking into place as the game started.

                    <p>
                    	In Ultimate Ascent, opposing alliances work to score as many discs in the goal as possible. The higher the goal is, the more points are scored when a disc goes in. Near the end, robots could climb a large pyramid structure and got point based on the height climbed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       	Ted X was designed as a scissor lift that could move up and down to both position itself for goals and climb the middle structure. When given discs by a human player, it could shoot them out into the goals. It was also equipped with rubber grips to help climb the middle structure. The height of Ted X also allowed the robot to play defense, preventing other robots from scoring goals.

              </h3>
              <p>
                  Two opposing alliances compete to score as many basketballs into their hoops as they can. The higher the hoop in which the basketball is scored, the more points the alliance receives. The match ends with robots attempting to balance on bridges located at the middle of the field. One robot from each alliance will also try to balance on the white coopertition bridge to score additional ranking points for each alliance.              </p>
